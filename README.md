# victorian-crash-data-analysis

The Victorian road crash datasets provide comprehensive information across multiple related tables, including accident circumstances, event classifications, road characteristics, and environmental conditions. Further details about the dataset are available at: https://opendata.transport.vic.gov.au/dataset/victoria-road-crash-data

The availability of this rich dataset enables an in-depth examination of patterns and contributing factors associated with road crashes.

The project focuses on the following research question: What is the likelihood of collision among male drivers aged 30–39, considering factors such as road surface conditions, weather conditions, helmet or seatbelt usage, and overall road conditions? Investigating this question aims to generate insights that may assist policymakers in designing more targeted and effective road safety interventions.

To address the research question, a structured analytical workflow was applied, including data preparation, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modelling.
The modelling techniques used in this project include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

My individual contribution focused on:
- Writing SQL queries to explore, join, and filter multiple tables
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns
- Supporting the formulation of the research question based on data insights

Other components, including parts of the predictive modelling, were completed
collaboratively by the team.
