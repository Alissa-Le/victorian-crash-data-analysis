# victorian-crash-data-analysis
The Victorian road crash datasets provide comprehensive information collected across multiple related tables, covering accident circumstances, event classifications, road characteristics, and environmental conditions. Further details about the data can be found at: https://opendata.transport.vic.gov.au/dataset/victoria-road-crash-data.

The availability of this rich dataset enables an in-depth examination of patterns and contributing factors associated with road crashes.

This project focuses on the following research question: What is the likelihood of collision among male drivers aged 30–39, given factors such as road surface conditions, weather conditions, helmet or seatbelt usage, and overall road conditions?
Exploring this question aims to generate insights that may assist policymakers in developing more targeted and effective road safety strategies.

To answer the research question, a structured analytical workflow is applied, including data preparation, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modelling. The modelling techniques used in this project include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
